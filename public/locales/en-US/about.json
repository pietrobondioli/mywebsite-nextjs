These APIs were intended to serve as a base for data consumption by Chatbots, and were developed mainly using C# and .NET Core, sometimes also using Node.JS and Express.JS. Also, I had to deal with the whole ecosystem that surrounded these APIs: Azure Devops, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Seq Log.",

The refactoring was done using Micro Frontends pattern, along with React.JS and its entire ecosystem. In addition, I brought to the backend of the project (Java, Spring Boot) practices of using technologies such as: Docker, Docker Compose, Log4J, Graylog. This experience not only helped me to grow technically but also helped me to improve my management skills, since for the refactoring of this front-end I counted with the help of two interns that were in the process of learning.",
